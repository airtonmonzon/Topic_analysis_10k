# Topic_analysis_10k
The information presented is a topic analysis of the MD&amp;A section of the 10k annual reports of the SP&amp;500 companies.

The codes used are divided into three:
1. Data Extraction from the SEC
2. LDA Topic Analysis
3. Graphical Analysis of the Results

Please note that the first part of the code may take time to download because it covers 500 companies and spans 10 years,
so it involves a large number of text files.

The data in 'Input' its an example of the data of the total 10-k. All data can't be upload for a size problem.
